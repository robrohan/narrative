# Introduction

Narrative is a technique to comment code to produce both the code itself, and at the same time create documentation (a manual, a tutorial, etc) about the code.

It is a similar idea to, and was inspired by, literate programming. Narrative is more focused on guiding someone through the code than on producing an academic paper.
